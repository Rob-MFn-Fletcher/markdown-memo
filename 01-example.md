Subsection 1.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last week, I had such an intellectually engaging time at the
[3rd International Summer School in Philosophy of Physics](https://sites.google.com/site/isspp2015/).
The topic of the summer school was "The ontology of physics."
Most of the attendees were philosophy Ph.D. students studying
philosophy of science, and there were
some theoretical physicists focussing on the foundations of quantum
mechanics. I was the only experimental physicist there, and I gave a
talk giving a big-picture summary of the ATLAS experiment. While
studying philosophy independently has been a passion of mine for a long
time, it was such a unique experience for me to be among that crowd, as
it was my first philosophy summer school or conference. I have so many
ideas spinning in my head. I hope I can spend more time fleshing out
what the school got me thinking about in this blog, but first I want to
discuss something more basic to the entire effort: what is ontology?

Ontology is the study of what exists, what is the nature of being, 
and what it means "to be". It is a sub-branch of the larger branch of
philosophy called metaphysics, which deals some of the most fundamental
questions in philosophy like---What is the nature of reality?
What exists in the world? What is it like? What is real?
What is the nature of space and time? etc. 
Ontology is the focus on---What are the things that exist in the world,
its furnishings, ingredients, or parts?
What kinds of things are they?
Are they waves, or particles, or something else?

Subsection 1.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People have various reactions when you ask them---what is real? Can we
claim to know anything about reality? Is it a goal of science to
describe reality? Does science make any progress at describing reality?

*Realism*[^Realism] is one of the deepest and oldest issues in
philosophy. Very roughly, to be a realist about something is to support
the claim that the thing in question exists in the world independent of
our conceptualizations of it (*i.e.* independent of one's beliefs,
linguistic practices, conceptual schemes, etc.). Closely related to
realism is a notion of *objectivity* that real things should have. When
one says something is real, they claim that it exists objectively in a
way independent of any person's particular subjective experience. One
can be realist or anti-realist about many things, often with differing
positions depending on the subject matter, *e.g.*, the external world
generally, the scientific image of the world, ethics, aesthetics, etc.
In what follows, we will focus on the debate over scientific realism:
whether science makes progress at revealing truths about reality. I
cannot pretend to be able to summarize or give a final word to the issue
here, but I would like to give a coarse classification of the possible
positions, walk through some the basic arguments, and end with in
unembellished case in support of scientific realism.

Most would agree that
science is a human enterprise that chronicles observed phenomena,
builds models that attempt describe and explain the nature of that
phenomena, and performs some empirical tests to evaluate the success of
those models. Not everyone agrees on how the success of science should
be interpreted.
According to the ***Very Coarse Classification of views of science* (VCC)**
that I propose here, one can loosely group the
possible positions one can take in response to the claim that science
makes progress at revealing (at least approximate) truth about reality.
Let's get them on the table, ordered from more undoubting to more
skeptical:

1.  Na&iuml;ve realists
2.  Scientific realists
3.  "Scientifically sympathetic" anti-realists (*e.g.* positivists and constructive empiricists)
4.  Relativists (*i.e.* anti-realists that are skeptical of objectivity).

*Na&iuml;ve realism* (or *direct realism*) is to take the common sense
appearance of the world as real. This is how most if not all of us grow
up seeing the external world, granted as real. It is usually not until
we've thought about it long enough or been exposed to some basic
philosophy that we learn to recognize that we might call the mountains
on the horizon real and existing before (and after) we came to see them,
but not in the same way that we might claim a legal contract is real or
not, or fiat money, or a song, or Newton's law of gravitation. If
considering how the metaphysical grounding or sense of existence could
be different for those things is a new or strange consideration for you,
Jim Baggott's *A Beginners Guide to Reality*[^Baggott] is a gentle
but engaging introduction to the debates surrounding the levels of
realism.

If we agree we'd like to know what's real,
arguably the most compelling and exhaustive body of knowledge about the
world that humans have acquired is through the many fields of study
practiced in the sciences (broadly understood, including physical
sciences like physics and chemistry as well as social sciences including
history and sociology, among others[^Feynman]).
Especially in its rapid progress in the last three hundred or more years,
science has increasingly erected explanations where there were previously
speculations and myths concerning the nature of matter, the movements
of astronomical bodies, the complexity and functions of life, and many
other areas of investigation. Along with the reductive understanding of
successful scientific theories also comes technological capability and
engineering, the power of which is so ubiquitous and clear today that it
is not hard to see why one might think there is something *real* in
the claims affirmed by science.

[^Feynman]: @Feynman_1963_feynman_lectures_vol1_ch3\.

Chakravartty[^Chakravartty] defines *scientific realism* as

> Scientific realism is the view that our best scientific theories give
> approximately true descriptions of both observable and unobservable
> aspects of a mind-independent world.

[^Chakravartty]: @Chakravartty_2007_metaphysics_for_scientific_realism and @Chakravartty_2011_SEP_scientific_realism\. See also "[Scientific realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_realism)" - Wikipedia.

The explanatory power of science makes scientific realism appealing.
If it were true, one could argue that scientific realism has profound
epistemological, metaphysical, ethical, and political implications insofar
as it could settle debates about the *real states of affairs in the world*.
But before we act so sure of having such a firm grip on reality, let us
survey many of the reasons one might be skeptical of the success of
science at revealing reality. The remaining two classes of views in my
VCC are anti-realist rebuttals to scientific realism, one class of views
being more sympathetic with notions of progress and instrumental
efficacy in science but ultimately skeptical of metaphysical claims
about reality, the other class more radically skeptical of objective
notions of truth in general.
